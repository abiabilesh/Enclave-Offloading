abstract = {Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) enables user-level code to create private memory regions called enclaves, whose code and data are protected by the CPU from software and hardware attacks outside the enclaves. Recent work introduces library operating systems (LibOSes) to SGX so that legacy applications can run inside enclaves with few or even no modifications. As virtually any non-trivial application demands multiple processes, it is essential for LibOSes to support multitasking. However, none of the existing SGX LibOSes support multitasking both securely and efficiently.This paper presents Occlum, a system that enables secure and efficient multitasking on SGX. We implement the LibOS processes as SFI-Isolated Processes (SIPs). SFI is a software instrumentation technique for sandboxing untrusted modules (called domains). We design a novel SFI scheme named MPX-based, Multi-Domain SFI (MMDSFI) and leverage MMDSFI to enforce the isolation of SIPs. We also design an independent verifier to ensure the security guarantees of MMDSFI. With SIPs safely sharing the single address space of an enclave, the LibOS can implement multitasking efficiently. The Occlum LibOS outperforms the state-of-the-art SGX LibOS on multitasking-heavy workloads by up to 6,600x on micro-benchmarks and up to 500x on application benchmarks.},

abstract = {In recent years, researchers have proposed systems for running trusted code on an untrusted operating system. Protection mechanisms deployed by such systems keep a malicious kernel from directly manipulating a trusted application's state. Under such systems, the application and kernel are, conceptually, peers, and the system call API defines an RPC interface between them.We introduce Iago attacks, attacks that a malicious kernel can mount in this model. We show how a carefully chosen sequence of integer return values to Linux system calls can lead a supposedly protected process to act against its interests, and even to undertake arbitrary computation at the malicious kernel's behest.Iago attacks are evidence that protecting applications from malicious kernels is more difficult than previously realized.},

abstract = {Edge computing is a recent computing paradigm that brings cloud services closer to
the client. Among other features, edge computing offers extremely low client/server
latencies. To consistently provide such low latencies, services need to run on edge
nodes that are physically as close as possible to their clients. Thus, when a client
changes its physical location, a service should migrate between edge nodes to maintain
proximity. Differently from cloud nodes, edge nodes are built with CPUs of different
Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs), hence a server program natively compiled for
one ISA cannot migrate to another. This hinders migration to the closest node.We introduce
H-Container, which migrates natively-compiled containerized applications across compute
nodes featuring CPUs of different ISAs. H-Container advances over existing heterogeneous-ISA
migration systems by being a) highly compatible - no source code nor compiler toolchain
modifications are needed; b) easily deployable - fully implemented in user space,
thus without any OS or hypervisor dependency, and c) largely Linux compliant - can
migrate most Linux software, including server applications and dynamically linked
binaries. H-Container targets Linux, adopts LLVM, extends CRIU, and integrates with
Docker. Experiments demonstrate that H-Container adds no overhead on average during
program execution, while between 10ms and 100ms are added during migration. Furthermore,
we show the benefits of H-Container in real scenarios, proving for example up to 94%
increase in Redis throughput when unlocking heterogeneity.},
